records
=======

DNSimple dns record manager.


rationale
---


DNSimple has a solid api, but most of the time I just need to view and update host records. This is a DNSimple api wrapper that does *just* that. use it to view and change `CNAME` and `A` records. 

this module *wont* deal with other types of records such as `MX` etc. it also wont show you more info than what's required to update simple records and I intend to keep it that way.

`records` doesn't support basic auth because duh. 

go ahead, get wild!




cli
-------

`npm install -g records`

`records -h` for usage:
